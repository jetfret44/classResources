# Lab 1 Summary

## Environment Setup
- GCP Project ID: `mgmt599-davidjetter-lab1`
- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/jetfret44/classResources/tree/main
- Data Lake Bucket: mgmt599-davidjetter-data-lake

## Key Findings
1.  **Significant Profitability Discrepancies:** Not all sales are good sales; certain sub-categories like `Binders` and `Tables` are consistently unprofitable, often due to aggressive discounting.
2.  **Discounting as a Primary Profit Erosion Factor:** There's a strong inverse correlation between average discount rates and profit margins, particularly evident in the least profitable sub-categories.
3.  **Technology as the Core Profit Driver:** The `Technology` category consistently generates the highest total profit, highlighting its critical contribution to overall business health.

## DIVE Analysis Results
- Business Question Investigated: What are our most and least profitable products and product categories?
- Main Discovery: Certain sub-categories (e.g., Binders, Tables) are unprofitable due to aggressive discounting, while Technology is highly profitable.
- Strategic Recommendation: Implement strict discount controls for unprofitable products and re-evaluate pricing/supplier relationships for chronically low-margin items.

## Challenges and Solutions
- Challenge faced: Navigations and vast amount of options, learning curve was easier over time as I did get acclimated.
- How I solved it: Research and trial, several times to ensure a valid output.

## Time Spent
- Environment setup: 45 minutes
- Data lake creation: 10 minutes
- Analysis: 1.5 Hours
- Total: 2.5 Hours
