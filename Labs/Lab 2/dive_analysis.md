## D - Discover

### discover_prompt
What immediate patterns stand out compared to raw data?
What new insights does the pipeline transformation enable?"

### Processed Data Summary (Simulated)
*   **Raw Data State:** A large CSV file (`superstore_dataset.csv`) in GCS. Dates are `MM/DD/YYYY` strings, sales/profit are strings, quantities are strings. No inherent structure for direct analytical querying.
*   **Processed Data State (after pipeline):**
    *   BigQuery table `mgmt599-davidjetter-lab2.lab2_dataflow.processed_sales`
    *   `Order_Date` and `Ship_Date` are proper `DATE` types.
    *   `Sales`, `Profit`, `Discount`, `Profit_Margin` are `FLOAT` types.
    *   `Quantity` is `INTEGER`.
    *   All 19 fields are consistently named and typed.

### Key Findings at Discovery Stage

*   **Immediate Patterns Compared to Raw Data:**
    *   **Queryability:** The most striking difference is the immediate queryability of the data. In its raw CSV form, performing aggregations, date-based filtering, or numerical calculations would require manual parsing, type conversion, and loading into a tool. With the processed data in BigQuery, complex SQL queries (like the time-series, cohort, and product association queries we previously discussed) can be run directly and efficiently.
    *   **Data Integrity:** The type conversions eliminate common errors from string-based numerical operations (e.g., "100" + "50" = "10050" vs. 100 + 50 = 150). Date conversions ensure correct chronological ordering and filtering.
    *   **Schema Enforcement:** The structured BigQuery table enforces a consistent schema, preventing issues from malformed rows that might exist in a raw CSV.

*   **New Insights Enabled by Pipeline Transformation:**
    *   **Accurate Time-Series Analysis:** The `DATE` type for `Order_Date` allows for precise daily, weekly, and monthly aggregations, moving averages, and seasonality detection. This was cumbersome and error-prone with string dates.
    *   **Reliable Financial Metrics:** `FLOAT` types for `Sales` and `Profit` ensure accurate calculations of profit margins, average purchase values, and revenue impacts, which are critical for financial reporting and decision-making.
    *   **Customer Behavior Tracking:** The standardized `Customer_ID` and `Order_Date` enable robust cohort analysis, allowing us to track customer retention and lifetime value over time, which is nearly impossible without clean, typed data.
    *   **Product Association Discovery:** Consistent `Product_Name` and `Order_ID` combined with accurate `Sales` figures allow for the identification of frequently bought together items and their revenue impact, leading to cross-selling opportunities.

## I - Investigate

### investigate_prompt
"Our pipeline transformed data by [describe transformations].
This revealed [initial finding].
Why do these transformations uncover hidden patterns?
What business value does automated processing add?"

### Why Transformations Uncover Hidden Patterns

Our pipeline transformed data by:
*   Parsing CSV lines into structured records.
*   Converting date strings (`MM/DD/YYYY`) to proper `DATE` objects.
*   Casting numeric fields (`Sales`, `Profit`, `Quantity`, `Discount`, `Profit_Margin`) to `FLOAT` or `INTEGER`.
*   Mapping raw CSV columns to named dictionary fields for a standardized schema.

These transformations uncover hidden patterns because:
*   **Correct Data Types Enable Correct Calculations:** Without proper `DATE` types, chronological analysis (trends, seasonality, cohort aging) is impossible or highly unreliable. Without `FLOAT` or `INTEGER` types, mathematical operations on sales, profit, and quantity would fail or produce incorrect results.
*   **Standardized Schema Ensures Consistency:** By mapping raw columns to consistent, named fields, the pipeline eliminates ambiguity and ensures that every piece of data is interpreted uniformly. This consistency is fundamental for reliable aggregation and comparison across the dataset.
*   **Structure Facilitates Complex Analysis:** Raw CSV is unstructured text. The pipeline imposes a relational structure, making it amenable to powerful SQL queries that can join, filter, aggregate, and apply window functions across various dimensions (time, customer, product, geography). This structure is what allows us to "see" patterns like retention curves or product associations that are invisible in raw text.

### Business Value of Automated Processing

Automated processing adds significant business value by:

*   **Speed and Freshness:** Eliminates manual data preparation, drastically reducing the time from data ingestion to actionable insights. This directly addresses the "impact of processing delays" by minimizing them. Decisions can be made on near real-time data, not stale information.
*   **Accuracy and Reliability:** Reduces human error inherent in manual data handling and ensures consistent application of transformation rules. This leads to more trustworthy data and, consequently, more reliable business decisions.
*   **Scalability:** Can handle large volumes of data efficiently without human intervention, allowing the business to grow without being bottlenecked by data processing.
*   **Resource Optimization:** Frees up analysts and data engineers from repetitive, low-value data cleaning tasks, allowing them to focus on higher-value analysis and strategic initiatives.
*   **Enabling Advanced Analytics:** Provides a clean, structured foundation for more sophisticated analyses, machine learning models, and real-time dashboards that would be impossible with raw data.

## V - Validate

### validate_prompt
"Our pipeline assumes [list assumptions].
What could go wrong with these assumptions?
How would we detect if the pipeline is producing incorrect results?
What validation checks should we implement?"

### Pipeline Assumptions

Our pipeline assumes:
*   **Consistent CSV Format:** The input CSV file will always adhere to a consistent delimiter (comma), quoting rules, and column order.
*   **Consistent Date Format:** All date strings (`order_date`, `ship_date`) will consistently be in `MM/DD/YYYY` format.
*   **Valid Numeric Data:** Fields intended for numeric conversion (`Sales`, `Profit`, etc.) will contain valid numeric characters.
*   **Header Row Presence:** The first row is a header that should be skipped.
*   **Data Integrity:** The source data itself is generally sound (e.g., no duplicate `Order_ID`s that should be unique, no illogical values like negative quantities unless intended).

### What Could Go Wrong with These Assumptions?

*   **CSV Format Changes:** If the delimiter changes, a column is added/removed, or quoting rules change, the CSV parser will fail or misinterpret columns, leading to incorrect data mapping.
*   **Date Format Inconsistencies:** If some dates are `DD-MM-YYYY` or `YYYY/MM/DD`, the `PARSE_DATE` function will fail, resulting in null dates or pipeline errors.
*   **Invalid Numeric Data:** If a `Sales` field contains "N/A" or "abc", the `FLOAT` cast will fail, causing pipeline errors or null values.
*   **Missing Header:** If the header row is missing, the first data row will be incorrectly treated as a header and skipped.
*   **Source Data Issues:** Even if the pipeline runs, if the source data has logical errors (e.g., `Sales` values are off by a factor of 100), the processed data will be "clean" but still incorrect.

### How to Detect Incorrect Results

*   **Pipeline Logs:** Monitor Dataflow job logs for errors related to parsing, type conversion, or BigQuery writes.
*   **BigQuery Schema:** Regularly check the BigQuery table schema to ensure it matches expectations and hasn't been implicitly altered by bad data.
*   **Row Counts:** Compare the number of rows processed by the pipeline to the number of rows in the source CSV.
*   **Data Profile:** Periodically run queries to profile the data (e.g., `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `COUNT(DISTINCT)`, `COUNTIF(column IS NULL)`) to spot anomalies.

### Validation Checks to Implement

1.  **Schema Validation:**
    *   **Check:** After writing to BigQuery, compare the actual table schema against a predefined expected schema.
    *   **Method:** Use BigQuery's `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` or programmatically check the table's metadata.
2.  **Row Count Check:**
    *   **Check:** Verify that the number of rows in the BigQuery table matches the number of data rows in the source CSV (minus header).
    *   **Method:** `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_bq_table;` and compare to source file line count.
3.  **Null Value Checks:**
    *   **Check:** For critical fields (e.g., `Order_Date`, `Sales`, `Customer_ID`), ensure there are no unexpected nulls after transformation.
    *   **Method:** `SELECT COUNTIF(Order_Date IS NULL) FROM your_bq_table;`
4.  **Date Range Validation:**
    *   **Check:** Ensure `Order_Date` and `Ship_Date` fall within expected historical ranges and that `Ship_Date` is always on or after `Order_Date`.
    *   **Method:** `SELECT MIN(Order_Date), MAX(Order_Date) FROM your_bq_table;` and `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_bq_table WHERE Ship_Date < Order_Date;`
5.  **Numeric Range Validation:**
    *   **Check:** Verify that numeric fields (`Sales`, `Profit`, `Quantity`, `Discount`) are within reasonable bounds (e.g., `Quantity` > 0, `Discount` between 0 and 1).
    *   **Method:** `SELECT MIN(Sales), MAX(Sales), MIN(Quantity), MAX(Quantity) FROM your_bq_table;`
6.  **Data Consistency Checks:**
    *   **Check:** For categorical fields (`Category`, `Region`), ensure values are consistent and no new, unexpected categories appear.
    *   **Method:** `SELECT DISTINCT Category FROM your_bq_table;`

## E - Extend

### extend_prompt
"Given our pipeline can process data in [X] minutes,
how should this change our business operations?
What real-time decisions can we now make?
What additional pipelines should we build?"

### Impact on Business Operations (Assuming X minutes processing time)

Given our pipeline can process data in **[e.g., 15-30] minutes** (a typical range for a batch Dataflow job of this scale), this significantly changes our business operations by:

*   **Enabling Daily/Hourly Reporting:** Instead of weekly or monthly manual data pulls, reports can be refreshed multiple times a day, providing a much more current view of sales performance.
*   **Proactive Problem Solving:** Anomalies (flagged by the time-series query) can be identified and investigated within hours, rather than days or weeks, allowing for quicker intervention (e.g., addressing a sudden sales drop, investigating a suspicious spike).
*   **Agile Marketing & Sales:** Marketing campaigns can be adjusted based on near real-time sales data. Sales teams can be informed of top-performing products or regions more frequently.
*   **Improved Inventory Management:** While not directly in this pipeline, fresh sales data is critical for optimizing inventory levels, reducing stockouts, and minimizing holding costs.

### Real-Time Decisions We Can Now Make

*   **Dynamic Pricing Adjustments:** If a product's sales suddenly spike or drop, pricing can be adjusted more quickly.
*   **Targeted Promotions:** Identify products that are selling well together (from product association analysis) and immediately launch cross-selling promotions.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Reallocate sales staff or marketing spend to regions or categories showing immediate growth or decline.
*   **Fraud Detection (Basic):** Unusual order patterns or high-value anomalies could be flagged for immediate review.
*   **Customer Service Prioritization:** Identify customers with recent high-value purchases or unusual activity for proactive engagement.

### Additional Pipelines to Build

1.  **Real-time Dashboard Pipeline:**
    *   **Purpose:** Stream processed sales data into a real-time dashboarding tool (e.g., Looker Studio, Tableau, Power BI) for continuous monitoring of key metrics.
    *   **Source:** BigQuery table (or potentially a Pub/Sub topic if moving to streaming ingestion).
    *   **Destination:** Dashboard.
2.  **Anomaly Detection & Alerting Pipeline:**
    *   **Purpose:** Continuously monitor sales metrics (e.g., daily sales, profit margin) and automatically trigger alerts (e.g., via Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub to Slack/email) when predefined thresholds or statistical anomalies are detected.
    *   **Source:** BigQuery table (or streaming data).
    *   **Destination:** Alerting system.
3.  **Customer Segmentation & Personalization Pipeline:**
    *   **Purpose:** Build on the cohort analysis to segment customers based on purchasing behavior, frequency, and value, then feed these segments into marketing automation platforms for personalized outreach.
    *   **Source:** BigQuery `processed_sales` and potentially CRM data.
    *   **Destination:** Marketing automation platform, customer data platform.
4.  **Predictive Analytics Pipeline:**
    *   **Purpose:** Use historical processed sales data to train machine learning models (e.g., in Vertex AI) for sales forecasting, demand prediction, or customer churn prediction.
    *   **Source:** BigQuery `processed_sales`.
    *   **Destination:** Vertex AI models, BigQuery tables for predictions.
5.  **Incremental Loading Pipeline:**
    *   **Purpose:** For production scenarios, switch from `WRITE_TRUNCATE` to an incremental loading strategy (e.g., appending new data daily/hourly) to handle continuous data streams more efficiently.
    *   **Source:** New CSV files or streaming sources.
    *   **Destination:** BigQuery table.
